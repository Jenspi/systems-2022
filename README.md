## Table of Contents:
### HW1: Array Copy
Copies over arrays row x row and column x column to see which is more efficient at larger data sets.

### HW2: Math Operations
We created math operations to be performed on integers without the use of +,-, \*, using operations like sll instead (unfinished). We also converted our ArrayCopy file from HW1 to two different assembly outputs to observe the differences in code.

### Project: Garfield
For our final project, I made a Discord bot using Python. This bot has some basics: check its ping, check user details e.g. account creation or server join date, check when the server was created... and some games: challenges your typing speed and a spelling game.
