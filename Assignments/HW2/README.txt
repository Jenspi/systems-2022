CSCI 2467 (Systems) // Jennifer Spicer // March 2022

This assignment builds on our previous one. PART 1 focuses
on creating two different assembly outputs with our C file
from the first assignment, and comparing the differences
and similarities between the two assembly files. We also
experiment with the GDB command and its supporting commands
on our C file. PART 2 is creating functions for simple math
operations without using logical operations or signs. This
is to get us comfortable with using bitwise operations.
